Aspiring leaders often ask me:

> How do I balance managing a team with my responsibilities as an individual contributor?

When I first stepped up into a management role, my boss warned me that that a problem many people face is time management: balancing the responsibilities of developing software with the additional responsibilities of leading teams and managing people.


### Delegating

A mistake I made early on is not delegating enough. I felt a sense of responsibility in making sure that I was on top of everything asked of my team:

* Every piece of work in progress
* Every plan being proposed
* Every task on the Agile board.

When new work was asked of my team, I felt a strong desire to 'protect' the team from distractions, context-switching or emergency work. Often, I would pick this work up myself. In this time when I was supposed to be pivoting my attention more towards people, strategy and organisational concerns, I was paradoxically pulling myself ever-deeper into routine, business-as-usual software development tasks.

In addition, I was occupied with trying to influence other teams in the area to adopt a common technology strategy, and had become immersed in defining the product direction and managing stakeholders, such as operational teams, new product development and analytics.

My attention had become spread so thinly that I no longer had the available headspace to effectively manage the kinds of incoming requests that only leadership could deal with:

* When a large part of GDPR fell within my team's ownership area
* When a mandatory migration to a new service was needed
* When my fellow managers asked for assistance

Before long, my manager called me into their office and said something like:

> I was hoping that you would pick up tasks X, Y and Z for the department, but you seem to have dropped the ball on these. It's quite clear to me what is going on: you look overworked. Are you delegating enough? Are you insisting on the support that you need from your team, from your product counterpart and from your peers? Are you managing your time effectively?

They were right. I was not insisting on the support that I needed in order for the whole team to be effective. I was not putting the responsibility for the team's work with the team, but was shouldering it myself. And I was not insisting on the support that I needed from my counterparts within the team. **I realised that it was time to get serious about delegating.**

An exercise I found helpful in the beginning was as follows:

* Write down all the tasks I completed, at the end of each day
* Asterisk any tasks that I alone could have done
* Circle any tasks that could have been delegated to someone else

This clearly laid out how much work I was doing that in fact could and should have been done by *anyone else* on the team, while the work that *I alone* as the manager could do was being left undone, impacting the team as a whole.

This revelation led directly to me requesting significantly more work from my team members and putting significantly more responsibility for its completion with them.

Initially, I was apprehensive when raising such needed work to the team, because I knew how little power anyone has to actually *make people do things*. The following fears echoed in my mind: 

* What if no one picks this work up?
* What if the team members complain?
* What if the team is genuinely too busy?

Over time, I learned to create the space within the team where the problems and their priorities were understood. This allowed the team itself to decide how best to pick up new tasks and absorb them into the team's current workload. My role was to ensure that the team had the support that it needed, to provide guidance and clarity, and to understand, process and communicate feedback from the team to the rest of the organisation. Once the team understood the roles and responsibilities of each member, the people themselves were able to hold each other accountable to ensure that the team as a whole was delivering.


When I was volunteering to pick up all the incoming business-as-usual work items, I was severely restricting my capacity to work on genuine management tasks. I realised that if I was picking up all the incoming work by default, I was robbing my team of opportunities to step up, out-perform and deliver beyond what they thought was possible. I was shielding them from learning opportunities, in a way that would be determinental to their long-term development. I realised that everyone on the team needs to become a self-sufficient representative of the team.

As my expectations of the team members increased, my trust in them increased, too. I learned that people need to be given the chance and opportunity to succeed or fail on their own terms, on real projects that actually matter, in order to learn and grow.

### My 'first' team

When I became a manager, I gained a second team that is actually my *first* team:

* My boss; for example: head of division
* My peers; for example: other technical people managers
* My counterparts; for example: product managers, principals

In the context of my *first* team, I learned that I am representing no longer just myself, but my entire team as an extension of myself. Within the team, I learned that I am no longer representing a single contributor, but the extension of the entire leadership function into the team.

With this re-framing of my role clear my mind, I realised that my responsibility now is to align my team's resources and capabilities with the rest of the organisation to ensure they are effectively brought to bear to meet the company's most important goals and objectives. My team was there to help us all achieve the priorities and business objectives set out by the company. 

When my manager asked me to deliver tasks, it was *implicit* that I would leverage the full capabilities and capacities of the available resources in order to achieve them. *Of course* I should use whatever resources are available, as effectively as possible, to achieve company goals. This was not *in addition* to my work; this *was* my work.

When I was unable to bring my resources to bear for the department's most important and urgent priorities, my manager rightly started to dig in further. Why? From their point of view, I have been assigned significant resources in order to deliver what needs to be done. My manager would not tell me how to use these resources. It was my job as a manager to learn how to do this myself. My manager was trying to help me see this, so that I could learn and grow.

What then is my role on my team?

* Support, guide, mentor, coach and facilitate the team
* Provide strategic and technical direction
* Planning, from high-level roadmaps to project-specific plans
* Review work and provide meaningful feedback that lands
* Connect-the-dots through leveraging my knowledge and network
* Ensure effective alignment with the rest of the organisation
