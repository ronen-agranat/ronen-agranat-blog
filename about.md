**Hi! My name is Ronen Agranat. Welcome to my personal blog and website!**

### What's on this website?
On my website, you can find out a whole lot about me: my CV, my blog articles, descriptions of projects I've worked on,
and more about my interests.

### What's in it for you?
* I'll try to share useful information here that I found valuable -- hopefully, someone will find it helpful.
* If you're interested in being mentored or coached, or even if you just want a second opinion on a project that you're
working on, or even a single line of code, reach out and let's see what you've got going on
* You can find my contact details as well as other social media links at the bottom of the page

### Now, some more about me 
I'm from the beautiful, sunny city of Cape Town, South Africa. I currently live in the somewhat less-sunny but also
beautiful (in a different way) city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

I've been working with computers ever since I learned to program BASIC on my father's Casio calculator from books at the
primary school library. I built, sold and repaired computers during middle school, assembled electronic parts for 
flight simulator kits and created a user interface for knitting machines in a textfile factory... in Visual basic 6...
that is still in use today :scream:

I studied electric & computer engineering at the University of Cape Town. While there, I won a Google competition and
got to visit their offices in Zurich. I tutored C++, which is where I discovered a passion for people and leadership.

Following university, I was lucky enough to work for Amazon EC2 for 4.5 years, during a period of hypergrowth as the popularity of
cloud computing soared. Fortunately, and perhaps surprisingly, the main offices for these services was in my home city
of Cape Town.

I then worked at a FinTech start-up in Cape Town called Jumo which provides loans and other financial services
via virtual mobile "wallets" which are connected to the phones of customers across Africa, and widely-used and
highly popular in many African countries.

I moved to Amsterdam to work at Booking.com, which is the world's largest online travel agent and one of the largest
ecommerce sites (along with Amazon.com, of course).

### But enough about me
Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me, so I can find out more about you and what you're working on.

Until then, **tot ziens**!
